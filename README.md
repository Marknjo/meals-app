# :rocket: React Meals

## :balloon: Overview

This is a simple setup for exercising React muscles. This is not project specific. Just want to keep track of the code I learn.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project). Initially it was build with react create app. However, Vite has an edge over React for its speed and ease of use, including configuration and installing scripts.

The code base in this repo is built using React 18 and typescript. Previously, the code was written in vannila JavaScript. See v17-lab.
